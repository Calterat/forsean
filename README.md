# For Sean

My name is Julian. Welcome to my For Sean node app.


## Description

This is an MVP mini(full)-stack using Vue.js for the front end and Node.js for the back. Node.js utilizes MySQL through Sequelize, and Vue.js uses Axios to communicate to the Express.js server.

## Installation

> Clone repo with `git clone git@github.com:Calterat/forsean`. Then dive into the directory where you will find the frontend directory and the backend directory. Navigate to the backend folder and start with `npm install`. Then, boot up your MySQL shell and `source db/schema.sql`. Quit out of the shell. `npm run seed` will insert tables and data into the Database we created with the schema. Now the backend server is ready to run. `npm start` will get you cooking. Leave the back end server running. Jump to the root and navigate to the frontend folder. Run this server with `npm run serve`. Open up your browser and go to `localhost:8080`. Enjoy!
